### About

This project builds a low level version of an auto complete system in JavaScript. The trie can take in a new word and keep count of how many words have been inserted. Once words have been placed into the trie it can offer some suggestions based on a word prefix. The suggest method takes in a word prefix and returns an array of words that match the desired prefix. The trie has a populate method and is populated with a standard dictionary of words. Finally the trie is packaged as a node module to import into future projects.
